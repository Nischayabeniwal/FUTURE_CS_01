# 🛡️ Web Application Security Testing – Vulnerability Assessment Project

This project is a hands-on cybersecurity internship task focused on identifying and documenting security vulnerabilities in web applications. It simulates real-world penetration testing for startups, SaaS products, or e-commerce platforms that need strong website security.

## 🔍 About the Project

This assessment involves scanning and exploiting test applications using popular ethical hacking tools. The ultimate goal is to document 3–5 real vulnerabilities, map them to the OWASP Top 10 threats, and produce a professional PDF security report with screenshots and mitigation strategies.

---

## ✅ What I Did

- Set up and explored vulnerable web apps (DVWA, OWASP Juice Shop, etc.)
- Performed scans using OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and Nikto
- Tested for:
  - SQL Injection (SQLi)
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Mapped all findings to the OWASP Top 10
- Created a detailed Security Assessment Report in PDF format
